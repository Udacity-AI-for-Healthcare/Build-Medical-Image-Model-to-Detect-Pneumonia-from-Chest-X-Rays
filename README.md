# Build Medical Image Model to Detect Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays

## Project Highlight
This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with 2D medical imaging data analysis and preparation of a medical imaging model for regulatory approval. Upon completion of this project, you would be able to:

- recommend appropriate imaging modalities for common clinical applications of 2D medical imaging
- perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on medical imaging data to inform model training and explain model performance
- establish the appropriate ‘ground truth’ methodologies for training algorithms to label medical images
- extract images from a DICOM dataset
- train common CNN architectures to classify 2D medical images
- translate outputs of medical imaging models for use by a clinician
- plan necessary validations to prepare a medical imaging model for regulatory approval

## Project Steps
This project has the following steps.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis

   Please refer to the `EDA.ipynb` notebook for the exploratory data analysis of the Chest X-Ray dataset.

2. Building and Training Your Model

    Please refer to the `Build and train model.ipynb` notebook for building and training the model.

3. Inference

    Please refer to the `Inference.ipynb` notebook for the inference of the model.

4. FDA Preparation

    Please refer to the `FDA_Submission_template.pdf` notebook for the FDA preparation of the model.
